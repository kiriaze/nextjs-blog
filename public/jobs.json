Our core software product, Cognite Data Fusion (CDF), powers companies with contextualized OT/IT data to develop and scale solutions that increase safety, sustainability, efficiency, and drive revenue.</p>\n<p>About the Database Reliability Engineering Team\nCognite’s Cognite Data Fusion contextualizes operational data at scale, enabling asset-intensive industries to make data-driven decisions. Our platform is built on many different technologies, each good at solving different problems. Some of these are absolutely fundamental, and the Database Reliability Engineering team will be responsible for the continuous well-being of our portfolio of FoundationDB, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch and Kafka clusters, some of which we expect to have thousands of in the years to come – in both public and private clouds, through managed services and on self-managed Kubernetes clusters.\nEven when using mature as-a-Service offerings and Kubernetes operators, there are many things that can and will go wrong. Herding clusters that need upgrading, upscaling, cost-trimming, and recovery etc., while continuously serving heavy workloads with tight SLOs requires solid reliability engineering.</p>\n<p>About our Tech stack:</p>\n<p>We work with open source technologies that need to run in multiple cloud environments – both public clouds (like Google Cloud Platform and Azure) and in private clouds with customer provided Kubernetes.</p>\n<p>Managed Kubernetes (GKE, AKS, Openshift) forms the base that we build our products on top of. To prove the market we initially built on PaaS offerings to store state, such as Google Bigtable, Spanner and Pubsub. We replicate data to different storage systems to be able to answer different types of queries. As we diversify the platforms our offering runs on, we are migrating to a self-run Foundation DB based scale-out data store for managing time series data.  PostgreSQL and Elasticsearch are also important examples.</p>\n<p>Our backend developer teams work with Java, Scala, Python, and Rust. CI/CD is handled by a combination of Github, Jenkins, and Spinnaker to test and deploy code to production. The infrastructure is managed as code with Terraform and Atlantis and services are monitored using Prometheus, Grafana and Lightstep.</p>\n<p>As we are establishing a team in Database Reliability Engineering we are looking to hire two people to work on FoundationDB. We are looking for senior or principal engineers, who either know FoundationDB, or have experience with other high performance distributed databases and an interest and willingness to dive deep and learn.</p>\n<p>The FoundationDB Kubernetes Operator is written in Golang, and FoundationDB itself is written in Flow, an Actor system that preprocesses C++ code.</p>\n<p>About the job to be done:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Join Cognite’s DBRE team as a FoundationDB sub-team, owning the full cluster lifecycle of all of our FoundationDB clusters.</li>\n<li>Work with both public clouds and on private Kubernetes deployments.</li>\n<li>Establish robust reliability engineering to support these clusters, managing aspects like monitoring, chaos testing, alerting, on-call rotations, internal best-practices education, and capacity forecasting.</li>\n<li>Enable product teams to focus on using the databases, and not on running them – but deeply engage them to make sure the products are operable at scale.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>About you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A master degree in Computer Science or a similar amount of experience.</li>\n<li>Broad experience with DevOps practices such as CI/CD and Infrastructure as code</li>\n<li>Experience with large Cloud deployments on any of AWS, GCP, or Azure.</li>\n<li>Familiar with C++, Golang or other programming languages.</li>\n<li>2+ years of direct FoundationDB operational experience or</li>\n<li>6+ years of Linux operations experience.</li>\n<li>2+ years working with similar distributed systems</li>\n<li>Familiarity and experience with our tech stack is beneficial.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What we offer you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An opportunity to make an impact on the industrial future and be part of disruptive and groundbreaking projects</li>\n<li>In-depth exposure to FoundationDB, a modern cloud-scale distributed datastore</li>\n<li>Help to relocate to Norway</li>\n<li>Competitive salary and benefits (including pension plans, insurance, benefits and more)</li>\n<li>IT equipment and tools to allow you to be productive</li>\n<li>Coverage of mobile telephone subscription and broadband connection</li>\n<li>Extended private health services and free yearly health check</li>\n<li>Free snacks and drinks throughout the day, to keep you running</li>\n<li>Subsidized lunch at the canteen, with various food options</li>\n<li>Free staffed gym</li>\n<li>Social activities (book club, team sports activities - football, boxing, regular Cognite social events)</li>\n<li>Free Norwegian courses for levels A1 - B1</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Equal opportunities\nCognite is committed to creating a diverse and inclusive environment and is proud to be an equal opportunity employer.

The site is already installed and a child theme set up. You would update the theme settings, child theme stylesheet, and set up Beaver Builder theme layouts and pages to match the design.</li><li>Client has WooCommerce installed and would like the SKU to display on the category page in addition to where it shows on the product detail page. You would check our Evernote internal knowledge base and do other searches if needed to find a WooCommerce filter and function and add it to their functions file.</li><li>Client needs to make customizations to their post feed in Beaver Builder to display an external link that they can change from the WordPress admin. You would add a custom field that shows on posts with something like Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) and then modify the Beaver Builder post feed module to display data from the ACF field on the frontend.</li><li>An old website with hundreds of already created posts and pages is being redesigned. You would create page templates and widgets that account for dynamic content in order to restyle existing posts in a way that ensures nothing slips through the cracks while working within the confines of the already existing website or proactively identifying new technology that would better serve the redesign and decrease redesign time.</li><li>A designer you’re working with has finished their mock up on a new site build, but is unsure how to handle dynamic content within their design. You proactively suggest solutions and utilize responsive frontend best practices to ensure the website looks good on every browser and every device regardless of what the content looks like.</li><li>You need to make a functionality update to a custom theme that is being used on 50 websites. You utilize WordPress hooks, conditional checks, default values for new options, as well as other backward compatibility best practices to push out updates that don’t break existing sites.</li><li>Client needs a way to display additional information blocks on a web page, using tabs. Each tab has a title and then content that is visible when a user clicks on the tab title. You would install a plugin like Advanced Custom Fields and set up a flexible content or repeater field group for tabs and assign it to the specific page or post type. Then you would update the child theme template to display these fields for that page or post type.</li><li>We’ve added a custom post type “People” to a client’s site so they can maintain bios and information about their staff, speakers, and others involved with their organization. We’ve added the main People archive page link to the navigation menu, but when you go to the page, it doesn’t show as the current page and highlight it or the parent page in the menu. To solve this, you would find another example in our internal knowledge base or research it or write it and update the CSS or jQuery to work for this site. Or if you’re not familiar with jQuery, you would create a new task for a RED team member who is familiar with jQuery to handle this update or to mentor you in learning how.</li><li>Client or team member posts that X is broken. You first try to replicate the problem, and then track down the issue and fix it.</li><li>Team member posts a task to our ‘task swap’ Slack channel for an extra task they don’t necessarily want to do. You can grab it if you’re interested, or let someone else pick it up. You can swap tasks you have, too.</li><li>You’re ready to launch a website. First you go through our pre-launch checklist and involve other team members in a peer review and cross browser check, then you go through the launch checklist. At the end of any process, if you notice places in documentation or steps that could be better, you discuss with the team and we integrate improvements as we go.</li><li>Utilize a development or staging website to update a feature. Once the project manager and client has reviewed the update, pull or deploy your changes to the public site.</li><li>Assist team members with questions about branches, working locally, and workflow.</li><li>Participate in our Professional Development site, where we each take the opportunity to learn about something we’ve been wanting to or learned while working on a project or listening to a podcast or reading, and share it back to the group.</li><li>Join the regular team video call, 3 times a month on average, where we catch up, share highlights and lowlights from what we’ve been working on, and learn something new from a team member’s presentation or project debrief, or talk through ideas or business development.</li></ul><div> </div><div> </div><div><strong>Required Tools</strong></div><ul><li>Internet connection</li><li>Photoshop CS 5.x or any version supporting grouped layers</li><li>Text editor or IDE capable of editing WordPress code</li></ul><div>  </div><div><br/></div><div><strong>Being detail-oriented is absolutely essential for this role.
